# Togo-Bot

## About

A problem at San Jose State University is the distance required to travel to acquire food from the Student Union to the dorms. 
To ***prevent students from going hungry***, the Spring 2024 Prospective New Members of San Jose State University Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity 
decided to ***create a robot*** that would be able to deliver items across 7th Street.

**Objective:** Create a Minimum Viable Product Autonomous Delivery Robot for San Jose State University
